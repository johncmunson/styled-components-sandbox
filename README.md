A repo to test out the styled-components package. This app was bootstrapped with create-react-app. I've had success styling HTML primitives i.e. const Button = styled.button`...` but there seems to be an issue with trying to style React components. See the src directory and the rendered output screenshot for details. UPDATE: Thank you to Rafal Filipek for pointing out my error. See below for his solution.

@johncmunson If you want to style a normal React component you have to pass className proprty like:
```
const Button = ({ className, children }) => <button className={className}>{children}</button>

const OmgButton = styled(Button)`
  font-size: 100px;
`;
```
`styled(Button)` will pass `className` property into Button component. This CSS class is generated by styled-components.
